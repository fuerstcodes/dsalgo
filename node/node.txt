#Data Structures: Node

A node is a fundamental building block for more complex data structures.
Nodes contain two types of information: 
    - immutable data (every kind of datatype)
    - link to another node (pointer)

Nodes can be linked together into a chain - if there is a node without a link to
another node, you have reached the end of this specific path. (pointer to null)

If there is a node without a link to it, it gets deleted from the chain. (Orphaned Node)
